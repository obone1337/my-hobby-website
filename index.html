<h1>Music Production</h1>

<p>Hello! This is a webpage about my favorite hobby. I love to produce music! My music isn't like other music, however. It is electronic music that I can make on my Mac.  I really enjoy electronic music, and I think it's cool that I can make it as well. I hope to become a professional DJ one day and play festivals around the world.</p>

<h2>Origins of Electronic Music</h2>

<p2><b>Electronic music has been around for quite some time, since 1950 to be exact. It was started in Germany, when people used electronic generators to create a new genre of music. Then, following the discovery, Japan and the United States began making their own electronic music in 1953. Electronic music especially flourished during the '80s, and is being used even more in popular music today.</b></p2>

<h3>How It's Made</h3>

<p3><b>When producing electronic music (from now on, we'll refer to it as EDM, or electronic dance music), you must have a good set of speakers, headphones, and a computer. In order to create your own EDM, you need to find a DAW that suits your preferences. A  DAW, or digital audio workstation, is what "houses" your plugins, midi, loop library, and music files. It acts much like the CSS file in a HTML webpage. Some examples are Ableton, Logic Pro, and FL Studio. When starting a song, make sure you have a consistent beat. It is crucial to include a beat; otherwise you rely on your own timing to space out your melodies and instrumentals. EDM is infamous for bass. If it is in your taste, include a very good and noticeable bassline. Include a basic melody and beat drop and you'll have your own EDM track. Don't forget to export to your computer's hard drive so that you can publish your creation!</b></p3>
